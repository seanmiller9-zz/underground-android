Android app which allows users to discover low key, hidden-gem style restaurants and attractions nearby their current location.


## Prerequisites ##

First, make sure to have Android Studio downloaded. Then, you will need to get a Google Maps API key - follow [the official instructions](https://developers.google.com/places/android-sdk/signup)
for more information. Navigate to ```/home/<username>/.gradle``` on Linux (or equivalent on another operating system), and locate the
file called ```gradle.properties``` - if it does not exist, create one. Then, within the file, insert the following line:
```GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY="<your_key_here>"```. Build the app, and you should now have access to the Google Maps API.


## Built With ##

* [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/) - Huge shoutout to Google for allowing developers to use the Google Maps API free of charge
